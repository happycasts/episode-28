1. file<->buffer<->windows
   1. file--harddisk
   1. buffer--mem
   1. windows--just windows

1. so buffer is the core.
   1. buffer is not the file: change sth in buffer, and its not in the `cat file`, until `:w`
   1. buffer is not the window: 
       1. :vs` to open one file in two window 
       1. compare `:bd` and Ctrl-W-C

1. buffer basics
   1. :ls and `:h ls`
   1. :b part_of_the_path<tab>  # to switch to the buffer, really cool

1. vim status line

   :h statusline

1. when you use `:bn` to switch among buffers, you see error when there is unsaved changes in current buffer, comes

   :set hidden

1. Ctrl-W-J to get the window you want to workon
   1. (Firstly open three window: two window for a function call, one for function def)

1. vim --remote

    vim --servername VIM-SERVER 
    vim --servername VIM-SERVER --remote-silent $* 

    1. use :vs to open the new buffer from remote vim client
    1. no more .swp error
        1. if file1 is already opened in vim-server, `vr file1` again won't give me a error
        1. but just do nothing, or bring file1 to the front window in vs if it isnot, really nice.

1. fuzzyfinder
   give it a really quick intro, and point people to its own episode
   1. :fufcoveragefile! 
   1. :fufbuffer!
