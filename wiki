:ls to get all the buffers, then you can use
:b part_of_the_path<tab> to switch to the buffer, really cool

:b# to switch between two related file

# do things

:bufdo
:tabdo
:windo

# Ctrl-O

:jumps

when you use `gf` or sth to go to another file, now you want to go back Ctrl-o is your friend,
if you use ctags, Ctrl_t is better

# vim status line

show current filename, this maybe seems useless, untail u open more than one window, try `vs`

# vim --remote
gvim does this nicely and easily

## now more .swp error
if file1 is already opened in vim-server, `vr file1` again won't give me a error, but just do nothing, or bring file1 to the front window in vs if it isnot, really nice.


## copy a colume to another vim instance

press control and select colume with mouse, not so hard, but I don't need this if I know

Q: how to open current buffer in vimserver:FOO
A: ?

# tabs and minibuffer explorer
they just show you all the filenames of the buffers, while everything is just a :ls away. Why do u need all the filenames takes prevcious editing space, and bring noise to your eyes. So lame!


# window is not buffer

compare `,bd` and Ctrl-W-C

Ctrl-W-J to get the window you want to workon(Firstly open three window: two window for a function call, one for function def)

# :h statusline
